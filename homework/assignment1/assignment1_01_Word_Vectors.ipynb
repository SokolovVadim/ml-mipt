Thus the same with the Shiloh Shepherd. Some facts: While the ISSR was founded in 1991 as the first Shiloh registry, it was only 6 short years later that the first non ISSR registry and club was formed. Thus the ISSR was only the sole Shiloh Registry for 6 years while there have been non ISSR registries for 8.  >>\\n\\nTINA\\'S  REPLY\\n\\nROTF ... Talk about \"\"smoke & mirrors\"\" ... WOW!!  Now let\\'s look at some *varifiable* FACTS!\\n\\n1. The ISSR was formed to CONTINUE the data collection that I started in 1974!!  When it was set up I had documented data on MY breeding stock going all the way back to the 60\\'s ... all of this was incorporated into the ISSR database!!  Therefor ... the information that we have goes back for OVER 40 YEARS .... not \"\"6\"\" as you have stated!\\n\\n2. The ISSDC/r did not start till 1998, and was CLOSED DOWN in 2001!!  Most of those breeders scattered at that point, some returning to the ISSR (via the amnesty) while others went back to breeding AKC GSD\\'s ... etc. ONLY the NSBR started another \\'registry\\' that most of the former ISSDC/r  breeders did not agree with because her \"\"rules\"\" were so lax!\\n\\n This is a copy of the legitimate document sent to Mr. Cavanaugh, president of the UKC!\\n\\nPlease take a moment to review a FEW \"\"highlights\"\" from the http://www.shilohshepherds.com/letterToUKC.htm\\n\\nIs that correct??  Does this mean that all GSD/mixes may now enter your \"\"new breed\"\" UKC Shiloh Shepherd genepool? \\nColleen Gott states on her website that \\n\\n<<**Paragon\\'s outcross program**  The Shiloh Shepherd is a breed that was created by intense line breeding and inbreeding of AKC German Shepherds many years ago.  In fact, at one time, all of the dogs in our Shiloh Shepherd pedigrees were AKC registered German Shepherds, with the exception of the first outcross used years ago, Secret Samson Woo. After using Secret Samson Woo, who was not a purebred German Shepherd, Rare Breed recognition was applied for and granted.  The kennel name \"\"Shiloh\"\", at which these breedings took place, was the name given to the new Rare Breed that was created - the Shiloh Shepherd.  Now, once more, has come the time for an introduction of new blood as many years of linebreeding have taken place again.  In an effort to overcome some of the intense line breeding and over usage of the same dogs up so close in our pedigrees, Paragon Shepherds is introducing into our breeding program, dogs that contain the \"\"Old\"\" lines from the very early days of the Shiloh Shepherd breed, that made the breed what it is. These dogs, AKC German Shepherds, with the Old Original lines, also contain a splash of new blood from German-German Shepherd lines, American-German Shepherd lines and some Czech lines.  >> (http://www.paragonshilohs.com)\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nHow can you consider this hodgepodge as a legitimate breed definition?\\n\\n<> \\n\\nWhat does German Shepherd “family” mean? Any GSD/mix?\\n\\nThe fact that you would even consider recognizing this motley mix as a separate breed is an insult not only to the definition of Breed but also to every owner of a purebred dog.\\n\\n3. Furthermore, let\\'s take a good look at the word *BREED* ... I don\\'t think that *anyone* will dispute that every credible organization does NOT consider a dog to be \"\"purebred\"\" unless it has at least 3 generations of PURE lineage!!\\n\\nYet these \"\"registries\"\" constantly encourage \"\"outcrossing\"\" (nice word for MIXING IN ANYTHING) in order to produce more pups .... please take a look at THIS quote from the above mentioned letter!\\n\\n<< <>\\n\\nhttp://www.shilohregistry.com/rules.html \\n\\nEven the hybrid breeders are not pleased with this development because the serious ones take great care in properly screening their prospective new owners and properly socializing all of the pups they produce! Please take a moment to read just one short excerpt that explains how most of them feel.\\n\\n<>    The Wolf Is At The Door, Inc. - What\\'s in a name? \\n\\n<',\n",

The paragraph beginning \"\"ICMEC found in its initial report that only 27 countries had legislation needed to deal with child pornography offenses\"\". This entire paragraph is just a series of claims made by ICMEC, not even a claim made by or supported by a neutral third party, so it should be worded to reflect that. We have more weasel in \"\"ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography\"\". We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis. A&C; Black. pp. 82–83, makes no mention of at all of child pornography, but talks about a conference on child custody problems in which the ICMEC took part, and which, according to the source resulted in \"\"little to solve the problems\"\". The third source is a strategic plan by the Hague Conference on Private International Law which again does not mention child pornography once. \\nThe last source talks about ICMEC being involved in training law enforcement officers in Thailand about child exploitation issues. This is not \"\"working with legislatures to adopt new laws\"\".

If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.  You\\'d also have to explain the significance you think you see in the fact that in this respect marriage is in no way different from the other sacraments, none of which was or could be recognized as a sacrament until a theology of sacraments was developed.  Isn\\'t that obvious?\\nAs for the latest edit, which said that the Council of Trent reaffirmed the existing teaching only \"\"from their perspective\"\", that is an utterly silly, unsourced, imaginative addition that contrasts with the clear decisive statement of the Fathers of the Council, who certainly wouldn\\'t have dreamt of adding phrases such as \"\"from our perspective\"\" to their clear reaffirmation of the existing teaching!

Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn\\'t involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not all that fluent in the language, but I\\'ve seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I\\'m not aware of?  \\n\\nI\\'ve since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga\\'s titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn\\'t normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  \\n\\nI\\'ll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) \\n\\nYes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, \\'bu\\' would be the',\n",

Again, welcome!\\xa0  \\n\\nHello!\\n\\nThanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.\\n\\nPick an image name.\\nWhen uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.\\n\\nSource the image.\\nOn the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it\\'s from the web, give a URL.  If it\\'s a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.\\n\\nProvide copyright and license information.\\nThis part is a little bit trickier, but it\\'s very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.\\nIf it\\'s a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn\\'t count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you\\'re using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.\\nIf you didn\\'t create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might \"\"create\"\", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as \"\"only for use by Wikipedia\"\", or \"\"for non-commercial use only\"\", or \"\"for educational use\"\".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.\\n\\nDescribe the image.\\nTo another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn\\'t explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  \\n\\nSome links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: \\n\\nCopyrights, Copyright tags, Fair use, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images\\n\\nThanks again for your contributions.

It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.\\n\\nYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.\\n\\nYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this.

The author of the book further makes all kinds of statements about Vietnamese that with distance sound condiscending or even worse. When the book starts talking about the Vietnamese mind, its almost embarrasing to read it. Yes, it won awards when it was published. But its a very flawed book. For example, the basis of your claim that only 800 people died in the anti-landlord campaign is that her North Vietnamese/NLF friends told the author so.

Given that, is it really a nemonic?\\n\\nA second thing I want to do is give for consideration the nemonic I learned way back when we used paper trig tables.

But I like to teach only the 1st three, OH, AH, Oh-Ah (simple enough), or even only the first two, OH AH  and have them (students) memorize only Sin, Cos, and Tan   then have them learn and understand that tan= sin/cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three.\\n\\nIt might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first, but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter  and it is silly enough to be memorable.

Palmer, I justified it by writing that \"\"Google returns 13500 hits for the query \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" cato [3].\"\" \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).\\nWell, sure, but that\\'s weak\"\"35000 is notable, but 19000 isn\\'t\"\". Come on. That\\'s not serious.\\n\\nBut even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don\\'t know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.\\nUnderstandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don\\'t care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it\\'s up for delete. What do I care. I really don\\'t give a damn. But some jerk says it\\'s non-notable (okay by meI didn\\'t konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer\\'s site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let\\'s take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain\\'t right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don\\'t care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.  \\n\\n\"',\n",

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\\n\\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\n\\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\n\\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\n\\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh',\n",

I\\'m trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I\\'m not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the \"\"To\"\" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person\\'s day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I\\'m therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –\\xa0 \\n\\nPlease note that if we did the table in \\'real-time\\' and not reconstructed history, we would have people like Charlotte Benkner lose the title when someone older was found, not when they died. Thus, it could technically be different.\\n\\nSecond, I realize it is not absolutely necessary; however, I do think a little redundancy is OK. Visually, if the cases are too close together, then their time with the title looks insignificant. {yakłtalk} \\n\\nDid you have to create my user page just in order to respond?

The user 82.224.230.5 would likely know that. It\\'s just trolling behavior.  What\\'s up, Doc? \\n\\nI\\'m not english and I rather be trolling right now than being a 12/13 years old wikipedia non-life geek (you know what I\\'m talkng about)!\\nOh, we know what you\\'re talking about, all right. Trust me.   \\nHis IP is French, so, yeah, I won\\'t hold his English skills against him. His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. \\nBack on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that \\'expert ~= god\\' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   \\n\\nSo according to you, it\\'s enough to only \"\"suspect\"\" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you \"\"suspect\"\", how sure is that?! why didn\\'t you even \"\"wonder\"\", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don\\'t you think ?!\\nI can\\'t believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) \\nI guess we should leave the \\'no high-school\\' line in there.  It has nothing to do with \\'scietific\\' vs \\'non-scientific\\'.   His methods are unquestionably scientific, which of course explains why so few high profile psychics and fakers apply for the million dollar challenge.    \\nI added it back in with a bit of useful context, and minus the inferred line about never having been to college, which is not supported by the given source.   \\n\\n Works for me.

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a \"\"child\"\", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.

Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a \"\"baby.\"\"  Then all sex with minors could be \"\"poor little babies being abused and raped,\"\" which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman\\'s, John Ashcroft\\'s, and David Finkelhor\\'s of the world.

Something like:\\n\\nProps\\n  Dean Greyling (NT)\\n  Rayno Gerber (SR)\\n  Rossouw de Klerk (CC)\\n  Basil Short (VC)\\n\\nHooker\\n  Chiliboy Ralepelle (NT)\\n(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012\\n\\nThe indicator would show the highest level the player played at during the season and players would be sorted by position first, then this indicator, then surname.\\n\\nHowever, an alternate representation could be:\\n\\n PropsNameNTSRCCVC  Dean Greyling                          Rayno Gerber                                      Rossouw de Klerk                                  Basil Short                                                 Hookers  Chiliboy Ralepelle                   \\n\\n(NT) Represented South Africa in 2012(SR) Represented the  in Super Rugby in 2012(CC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Currie Cup rugby in 2012(VC) Represented the Blue Bulls in Vodacom Cup rugby in 2012\\n\\nThis could again be sorted by playing position, then level played, then surname.  Footnotes can be used if a player represented a different Super Rugby franchise than the main one affiliated with the union, etc. A template (which is a slight variation on {{rugby squad player}}) can be developed to simplify this.\\n\\nAny thoughts, question, comments, suggestions, criticisms, etc?\"',\n",

              "       '\"\\n\\n Unprotected \\nI\\'m going to edit based on my comments in Talk:New_anti-Semitism#Sourcing_claims_for_.22Country-specific_incidents so could we discuss them now?  \\n\\nAll the incidents mentioned are regarded as examples of the new anti-Semitism i.e. coming from the left, related to radical anti-Zionism etc.  (talk) \\n\\nThey may well be, but they are not sourced that way.  \\n\\nI don\\'t think we can expect the words \"\"new anti-Semitism\"\" to appear in every single report we reference. We\\'ve defined it, and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:\\n\\nIt is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the \"\"new anti-Semitism.\"\" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.\\n\\nAll the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) \\n\\nMy worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I\\'d just want to tidy that up.  \\n\\nLivingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.  (talk) \\n\\nSlim, whose definition is this?   \\n\\nAll the sources put together. The above are the issues they agree on. It was posted weeks ago.  (talk) \\n\\nI think you mean \"\"all the sources from one side of the argument put together\"\".  It\\'s been a while since we discussed this, so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative?   \\nSorry, you\\'ll have to look in the archives; they\\'re either there or in the article. By \"\"all the sources,\"\" I mean all the sources who study new anti-Semitism. The above are the elements they appear to agree on.  (talk) \\nI\\'m asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative.  Please respond.  [[User:C',\n",

You \"\"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study\"\", while I believe that \"\"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead\"\". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.\\nAs to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.\\nOn the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.\\nMore directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a \"\"star polygon\"\", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a \"\"simple polygon\"\". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as \"\"simple\"\" or \"\"convex\"\" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person\\'s preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.\\nWith that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34\"',\n",

Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.\\nI also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.\\nIn all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I\\'ve explained above.\\nAnd since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.\\nIn addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:\\n\"\"Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one\\'s talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people\\'s requests of justification!\"\".\\nWhere do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I \"\"keep\"\" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: \"\"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again\"\" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? \"\"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing\"\" ... oh, \"\"we\"\". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I\\'ve created. Isn\\'t that a positive contribution?\\nLook: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them.

If anyone is being truly disruptive, an involved admin can adminster blocks as appropriate, but so far it seems to me that Quadell was acting in good faith when he edited in accordance with the MoS, Ambi was acting in good faith when she reverted his edits because the MoS is not policy and she felt the issue hadn\\\\\\'t been discussed enough, and VSmith was acting in good faith because he feels the MoS should be adhered to.

Palmer, I justified it by writing that \"\"Google returns 13500 hits for the query \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" cato [3].\"\" \"\"Tom G. Palmer\"\" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).\\\\nWell, sure, but that\\\\\\'s weak\"\"35000 is notable, but 19000 isn\\\\\\'t\"\". Come on. That\\\\\\'s not serious.\\\\n\\\\nBut even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don\\\\\\'t know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.\\\\nUnderstandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don\\\\\\'t care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it\\\\\\'s up for delete. What do I care. I really don\\\\\\'t give a damn. But some jerk says it\\\\\\'s non-notable (okay by meI didn\\\\\\'t konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer\\\\\\'s site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let\\\\\\'s take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain\\\\\\'t right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don\\\\\\'t care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people?

To conclude that a person’s statements must have been made under oath before they can be used to corroborate anything – let alone an event that is independently captured on film (and which lends credibility to the waiters’ accounts itself) – is nothing short of a fiction. I strongly recommend that you re-read WP:CITE and WP:RS. I haven’t dug around for mainstream media outlets reporting the news or the video and its authenticity for that matter (primarily because I just don’t care enough at the moment), but rest assured that if they have or do, I will recognize – compliant with Wikipedia guidelines – any Wikipedian’s citation of it. In fact, I’m likely to support its authenticity on its own accord, though I’m still debating the matter.

From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\\\n\\\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\\\n\\\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\\\\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\\\n\\\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth\\\\\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\\\\n\\\\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\\\n\\\\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\\\n\\\\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\\\n\\\\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh\\'\\n \"I\\'ve gone ahead and created the stub article: March of the Soviet Tankmen.

And that public request resulted in the Timonthy Geitner refusal to loan AIG anything.\\\\n\\\\nThen, Geitner, Paulson and Bernake were all 3 informed of the 100s of billions in mortgage insurance that AIG had issued and also the trillions in derivatives insurance that AIG had issued and informed of the further clear conclusions that \\\\n...\\\\nwithout supporting the AIG loan and allowing AIG to fail, this massive amount of market related insurance would cause a global market collapse.

This is not to say that your edit was improper; i\\\\\\'d have to read the book to know more.

Thanks,  \\\\n\\\\n Oldest people \\\\n\\\\nHi, I see you\\\\\\'ve reverted my changes with the comment \"\"current format has better visual appeal; Wikipedia is not paper\"\". I\\\\\\'m trying to understand but all I can make of this is a statement of personal taste, and I\\\\\\'m not convinced. Can we try to compare arguments? To me there are two disadvantages to the old format: 1. it contains duplicate information (the \"\"To\"\" column, saying when someone lost the status of oldest person, is always — necessarily so — equal to the person\\\\\\'s day of death); 2. it actually is less appealing to me because the information fills more space and there are many line breaks. It looks more tidy in my version. I\\\\\\'m therefore rather surprised at your change. Thanks for a reply. –\\\\xa0 \\\\n\\\\nPlease note that if we did the table in \\\\\\'real-time\\\\\\' and not reconstructed history, we would have people like Charlotte Benkner lose the title when someone older was found, not when they died. Thus, it could technically be different.\\\\n\\\\nSecond, I realize it is not absolutely necessary; however, I do think a little redundancy is OK. Visually, if the cases are too close together, then their time with the title looks insignificant. {yakłtalk} \\\\n\\\\nDid you have to create my user page just in order to respond? (My talk page did exist.) I was going to create it eventually, but in my own tome. How do I get it deleted again now (not just empty but deleted)? Such thoughtlessness really makes me angry. I\\\\\\'ve copied your comment here and I\\\\\\'m asking you to continue the debate on this page.\\\\n\\\\nI was aware of the theoretical argument you made.

His personality, and his intellectual abilities, however, are things that I will hold against him. \\\\nBack on topic, though, it is a common mistake that people make. People fail to understand that finding out the cause of flummery is a field in and of itself. Knowing when you need to enlist the help of an expert, and knowing what the expert is actually able to do, instead of assuming that \\\\\\'expert ~= god\\\\\\' - that is a skill that many people lack. I suspect that Randi knows more about most scientific fields than many experts know about scientific fields outside their expertise.   \\\\n\\\\nSo according to you, it\\\\\\'s enough to only \"\"suspect\"\" his scientifc knowledge to make disappear any kind of information related to his educational background ?!  I mean, is this the way wikipedia works ? you \"\"suspect\"\", how sure is that?! why didn\\\\\\'t you even \"\"wonder\"\", that would have been a better reason for making disappear my contribution about his educational career don\\\\\\'t you think ?!\\\\nI can\\\\\\'t believe guys like you run wikipedia like kings of the info.. simply pitious.—Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs) \\\\nI guess we should leave the \\\\\\'no high-school\\\\\\' line in there.

We\\\\\\'ve defined it, and we\\\\\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it. The definition is:\\\\n\\\\nIt is a form of Judenhass that emanates from the left. It is characterized by the demonization of the world\\\\\\'s only Jewish state and of Jews as an ethnicity and a religion. Israel\\\\\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied. The Jewish people\\\\\\'s right of self-determination is denied. Double standards are applied, whereby the actions of the Jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her. Jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the Jewish state. Symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism are used: for example, blood libels are resurrected, the Jewish state and Jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving Jews or Zionists or Israelis plotting to take over the world, or being in control of other governments, or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others. Arab and Islamic anti-Semitism are excused and ignored. Straw-man attacks are made, whereby Jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitism, and that is then used to condemn Jewish groups as unreasonable, and to deny that there is any such thing as the \"\"new anti-Semitism.\"\" All of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against Jews and their synagogues and schools, particularly in Europe. It is found in conjunction with anti-Americanism (because Jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the American government), anti-Zionism, and the anti-globalization movement.\\\\n\\\\nAll the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components, so when we find them, we can offer them as examples, so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-Semitism or attacks on Jews.  (talk) \\\\n\\\\nMy worry is that Livingstone has not been (at least in the sources provided) accused of anti-semitism, and that most of the discussion of Galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters.  Add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism (not reporting others allegations), which is OR (and unwise in the case of Galloway).  The NUS thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so I\\\\\\'d just want to tidy that up.  \\\\n\\\\nLivingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-Semitism (got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it), as has Galloway, and without question his supporters. The section talks about it in relation to that election. By all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit, and we can talk later if there are any disagreements.

I have re-read it and can still find none. You \"\"argue that we should make the definition of polygon consistent with what the lay public is likely to encounter and study\"\", while I believe that \"\"the elementary logic of physical objects is best used in the introductory lead\"\". That looks like agreement to me. Where we seem to differ is that you regard this as calling for a Euclidean mathematical definition, while I do not believe that the lay person has sufficient mathematical appreciation for that to be appropriate to the article lead.\\\\nAs to the actual content, the lead grew historically as a result of several contributors thrashing out our differing approaches. What emerged should not be treated lightly, or substantially edited without prior agreement. I am happy to discuss the rest of your  proposal, and no doubt others will chip in to help reach a consensus. I did restore a little of what you wrote, but in the mean time let us not play ping-pong with the page itself.\\\\nOn the matter of references, Regular polytopes and Convex polytopes are widely-read works which can hardly be described as specialised: they are indeed precisely what this lay person encountered and studied. Some others which I referenced are original sources - which, out of respect to you as a professional mathematician, I would not pull away from drawing to your attention. Others do move beyond a Euclidean treatment, and were there simply to make the point which begins the subsequent paragraph.\\\\nMore directly relevant is the issue that most lay people would regard a pentagram as a \"\"star polygon\"\", recognised as such since the days of Archimedes but excluded by the definition you gave, which is more formally understood as a \"\"simple polygon\"\". While mathematicians such as Grünbaum and yourself might choose to frequently omit descriptors such as \"\"simple\"\" or \"\"convex\"\" in treatments of these objects (Grünbaum explicitly, yourself implicitly), a general introduction to the subject can take no such luxury. The article lead should conform as far as is possible to the lay person\\\\\\'s preconceptions, whereby polygons may be divided into those which self-intersect and those which do not.\\\\nWith that proviso, if you have ideas for significant changes to the article lead, I would hope you can share them with us  first. — Cheers,  (Talk) 20:34\"\\'\\n \\'I resubmitted and approved it.

Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.\\\\nI also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.\\\\nIn all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I\\\\\\'ve explained above.\\\\nAnd since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.\\\\nIn addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:\\\\n\"\"Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one\\\\\\'s talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people\\\\\\'s requests of justification!\"\".\\\\nWhere do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I \"\"keep\"\" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: \"\"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again\"\" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? \"\"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing\"\" ... oh, \"\"we\"\". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I\\\\\\'ve created. Isn\\\\\\'t that a positive contribution?\\\\nLook: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  \"\\'\\n \\'\"\\\\n I don\\\\\\'t think you counted right, because per WP:3RR: \"\"a series of consecutive saved revert edits by one user with no intervening edits by another user\\\\xa0... counts as one revert\"\".

He clearly has not read the page, he clearly does not know the subject, and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to be done in circumstances like this: making valid claims supported with evidence. True, I don\\'t take Wikipedia seriously, but I believe in its potential. I wouldn\\'t do anything that I believe harms it in a substantial way. Tao, on the other hand, is an insidious virus who does little but undermine the value of Wikipedia. In a just world, he would be the one being blocked. This is not a genuine appeal against being blocked because I\\'m the one who asked for it. This is an appeal for you to actually read the conversation, read my swear-filled diatribe as me antagonizing someone who is genuinely very, very, very lazy in what he is doing (how long did it take to get me blocked after I even begged and taunted?)  please tell me, of the two of us who really should be blocked? Of the two of us, who is doing the most harm? Thank you.\"\\n \"Lamellae \\\\n\\\\nLamellae (cf lamina) are structures like stacked plates or the pages of a book, such as found in the gills of fish or mushrooms, and are quite different from the comb-like structures on the edge of a duck\\'s bill which should be referred to as pectines (singular pecten).\"\\n \"Nazis murdered six million of my people.

Most of those breeders scattered at that point, some returning to the ISSR (via the amnesty) while others went back to breeding AKC GSD\\'s ... etc. ONLY the NSBR started another \\'registry\\' that most of the former ISSDC/r  breeders did not agree with because her \"\"rules\"\" were so lax!\\n\\n This is a copy of the legitimate document sent to Mr. Cavanaugh, president of the UKC!\\n\\nPlease take a moment to review a FEW \"\"highlights\"\" from the http://www.shilohshepherds.com/letterToUKC.htm\\n\\nIs that correct??  Does this mean that all GSD/mixes may now enter your \"\"new breed\"\" UKC Shiloh Shepherd genepool? \\nColleen Gott states on her website that \\n\\n<<**Paragon\\'s outcross program**  The Shiloh Shepherd is a breed that was created by intense line breeding and inbreeding of AKC German Shepherds many years ago.  In fact, at one time, all of the dogs in our Shiloh Shepherd pedigrees were AKC registered German Shepherds, with the exception of the first outcross used years ago, Secret Samson Woo. After using Secret Samson Woo, who was not a purebred German Shepherd, Rare Breed recognition was applied for and granted.  The kennel name \"\"Shiloh\"\", at which these breedings took place, was the name given to the new Rare Breed that was created - the Shiloh Shepherd.  Now, once more, has come the time for an introduction of new blood as many years of linebreeding have taken place again.  In an effort to overcome some of the intense line breeding and over usage of the same dogs up so close in our pedigrees, Paragon Shepherds is introducing into our breeding program, dogs that contain the \"\"Old\"\" lines from the very early days of the Shiloh Shepherd breed, that made the breed what it is. These dogs, AKC German Shepherds, with the Old Original lines, also contain a splash of new blood from German-German Shepherd lines, American-German Shepherd lines and some Czech lines.  >> (http://www.paragonshilohs.com)\\n \\n\\n  \\n\\nHow can you consider this hodgepodge as a legitimate breed definition?\\n\\n<> \\n\\nWhat does German Shepherd “family” mean? Any GSD/mix?\\n\\nThe fact that you would even consider recognizing this motley mix as a separate breed is an insult not only to the definition of Breed but also to every owner of a purebred dog.\\n\\n3. Furthermore, let\\'s take a good look at the word *BREED* ... I don\\'t think that *anyone* will dispute that every credible organization does NOT consider a dog to be \"\"purebred\"\" unless it has at least 3 generations of PURE lineage!!\\n\\nYet these \"\"registries\"\" constantly encourage \"\"outcrossing\"\" (nice word for MIXING IN ANYTHING) in order to produce more pups .... please take a look at THIS quote from the above mentioned letter!\\n\\n<< <>\\n\\nhttp://www.shilohregistry.com/rules.html \\n\\nEven the hybrid breeders are not pleased with this development because the serious ones take great care in properly screening their prospective new owners and properly socializing all of the pups they produce!

We have more weasel in \"\"ICMEC has worked with legislatures in 100 countries to adopt new laws combating child pornography\"\". We have sources given for this. The first is invalid, being a press release from ICMEC. the second, Rhona Schuz (2014). The Hague Child Abduction Convention: A Critical Analysis.

If you want to insert a statement that marriage (like the other sacraments) was not always recognized as a sacrament, find a reliable source that says so and insert it at an appropriate point.  That appropriate point is obviously not the time of Trent, since by then marriage was not only generally recognized in the Church as a sacrament but had even been several times dogmatically declared to be such.

Also, it\\'s not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I\\'ve seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|talk) \\n\\nI have just added the Zuka Club to the \\'supporting characters\\' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I\\'m not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  \\n\\nWell, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I\\'ll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|talk) \\n\\n Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  \\n\\nI\\'ve added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the \\'supporting characters\\' section. Do you guys think it\\'s too much ...? And if not, could someone add the kanji and a picture?\\n\\nI added her picture, but I don\\'t know where to find the kanji for Kotoko.  (|talk) \\n\\nThey should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there\\'s a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can\\'t read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that\\'s what it says.\\n\\n Japanese Title \\nWhile glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn\\'t involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not all that fluent in the language, but I\\'ve seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I\\'m not aware of?  \\n\\nI\\'ve since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga\\'s titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn\\'t normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  \\n\\nI\\'ll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) \\n\\nYes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, \\'bu\\' would be the',\n",

I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.\\n\\nPick an image name.\\nWhen uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.\\n\\nSource the image.\\nOn the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it\\'s from the web, give a URL.  If it\\'s a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.\\n\\nProvide copyright and license information.\\nThis part is a little bit trickier, but it\\'s very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.\\nIf it\\'s a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn\\'t count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you\\'re using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.\\nIf you didn\\'t create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might \"\"create\"\", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as \"\"only for use by Wikipedia\"\", or \"\"for non-commercial use only\"\", or \"\"for educational use\"\".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.\\n\\nDescribe the image.\\nTo another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn\\'t explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.  \\n\\nSome links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: \\n\\nCopyrights, Copyright tags, Fair use, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images\\n\\nThanks again for your contributions.

              "       \"Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article \\n\\nNothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.\\n\\nYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.\\n\\nYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. \\n\\nIf you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.\\n\\nMorgan Wright\",\n",

( so that outside party is one who saved markets from collapse - not geitner , bernanke , paulson ) this lack of market knowledge by all three , paulson , geitner , and bernanke , is important to understand in understanding depth of market understanding in current proposals to allow us treasury to dictate systemic risk decision , when no one at the us treasury , other than saying those words , has shown any knowledge of markets to be able to determine what that is . / s / harvey keitel , markit bon vivant jr 69.121 . 221.97 iq & markets in the iq discussion in the article it is touted that the bernanke has a higher iq and that qualified him for his job . also it has been mentioned that he is an expert in depression era events . neither worked to have bernanke act appropriately in this global crisis which he / bernanke caused via fighting the spike in oil and gold prices and his efforts directly caused this crisis . so that with bernanke\\'s higher iq did not have him perceive what he was doing would cause a near global market meltdown and his studies of the depression era did not clue him in not to cause nearly a depression . / s too true ioq ix 69.121 . 221.97 demonizing wall street for us government caused crisis in the bubble , all agree was caused by greenspan , and in the huge push to give mortgages to those non qualified which all agree was caused by fannie mae , etc and by congress , this directly lead to the subprime debacle and beginning of the global crisis - none of which was caused by wall street . then in the fight by bernanke to stop the projected inflation caused by oil & gold spikes , his actions massively slammed the overall economy which was perking along just fine even with the subprime debaclev which was a smaller part of the usa $ 15 trillion economy . next , massive jaw boning of the huge crisis was done by paulson to get funds and that caused the coup de grace , the huge retrenchment of all spending by consumers ... all these events were not caused by wall street then paulson , bernanke and later hugely obama and congress , again and again bad mouthed again and again wall street claiming that this whole series of events was caused by wall street when it was mainly caused by the us governement and aided by consumer spending retrenchment but congres and the pundits caused the us population to believe the lie it was wall street\\'s fault due to gambling . all distortion 100 % . destruction of capital formation and wall street one of the key features of bernanke\\'s job in oversight for the usa economy is in also protecting capital formation ... and the engine of economic growth in the usa for 300 years has been the usa efficient capital distribution to new ventures , old ventures , etc and the recent sequence of bad mouthing by all concerned of wall street publicly now and including esp the talking heads on cnn and esp cnbc has severely damaged that core of the reason for usa dominance and leadership for those 300 years . added to that huge destruction is the special refusal by all of the us government to identify and prosecute the huge fraudulent short selling of all major wall street firms and major usa banks which was fraudulent esp as done in a intentional and ever increasing crecend',\n",

( talk ) they may well be , but they are not sourced that way . i don\\'t think we can expect the words \" \" new anti-semitism \" \" to appear in every single report we reference . we\\'ve defined it , and we\\'ve linked to many sources who are defining it . the definition is : it is a form of judenhass that emanates from the left . it is characterized by the demonization of the world\\'s only jewish state and of jews as an ethnicity and a religion . israel\\'s right to exist as an equal member of the world community is denied . the jewish people\\'s right of self-determination is denied . double standards are applied , whereby the actions of the jewish state are judged according to a different standard from the actions of all the neighboring states around her . jews as a people are held collectively responsible for the actions of the jewish state . symbols and images associated with classic anti-semitism are used : for example , blood libels are resurrected , the jewish state and jewish people are associated with wild conspiracy theories involving jews or zionists or israelis plotting to take over the world , or being in control of other governments , or being responsible behind the scenes for various acts of terror mistakenly attributed to others . arab and islamic anti-semitism are excused and ignored . straw-man attacks are made , whereby jews are alleged to claim that any criticism of israel is anti-semitism , and that is then used to condemn jewish groups as unreasonable , and to deny that there is any such thing as the \" \" new anti-semitism . \" \" all of the above is accompanied by an international resurgence of violence against jews and their synagogues and schools , particularly in europe . it is found in conjunction with anti-americanism ( because jews are believed either to control or be too influential with the american government ) , anti-zionism , and the anti-globalization movement . all the authoritative sources who have written about the phenomenon agree that these are the key components , so when we find them , we can offer them as examples , so long as someone has discussed them in terms of anti-semitism or attacks on jews . ( talk ) my worry is that livingstone has not been ( at least in the sources provided ) accused of anti-semitism , and that most of the discussion of galloway has nothing to do with the allegation of anti-semitism against his supporters . add to that that we appear to be accusing them of anti-semitism ( not reporting others allegations ) , which is or ( and unwise in the case of galloway ) . the nus thing is a bit ephemeral but has been discussed in terms of new anti-semitism so i\\'d just want to tidy that up . livingstone has very definitely been accused of anti-semitism ( got into quite a bit of trouble recently over it ) , as has galloway , and without question his supporters . the section talks about it in relation to that election . by all means go ahead and clean it up as you see fit , and we can talk later if there are any disagreements . ( talk ) slim , whose definition is this ? all the sources put together . the above are the issues they agree on . it was posted weeks ago . ( talk ) i think you mean \" \" all the sources from one side of the argument put together \" \" . it\\'s been a while since we discussed this , so could you remind me as to which sources you consider authoritative ? sorry , you\\'ll have to look in the archives ; they\\'re either there or in the article . by \" \" all the sources , \" \" i mean all the sources who study new anti-semitism . the above are the elements they appear to agree on . ( talk ) i\\'m asking you which sources you consider to be authoritative . please respond . [ [ user : c',\n",
